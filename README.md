# BoIA_project
Final project in the subject: Basics of Internet Applications.

To complete the project I used:
1) Bootstrap graphical interface, which was adapted to the needs of the application being created.
2) Functions from the jQuery library
HTML5 code and CSS sheets are compliant with W3C standards.
